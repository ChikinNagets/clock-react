# React Clock

This is a small app created with react vite with redux integrations. Created to schowcase redux uscases with sibling and child component partitioning. Information can be stores in a redux store making use of global variables to prevent prop drilling.

## TODO

1. Timer Stops when it reaches zero
2. Seconds in timer does not show in time format.
3. Design is lacking.
