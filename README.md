# React Clock

This is a small app created with react vite with redux integrations. Created to schowcase redux uscases with sibling and child component partitioning. Information can be stores in a redux store making use of global variables to prevent prop drilling.

## TODO

1. Timer Stops when it reaches zero
2. Seconds in timer does not show in time format.
3. Design is lacking.
4. Make reusable component for 'start', 'stop', 'reset' buttonts
5. Create utils file to stop and start time buttons for buttons component usage
